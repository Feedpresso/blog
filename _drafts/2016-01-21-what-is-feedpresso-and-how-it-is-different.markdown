Periodically we find ourselves in a position where we need to explain to
others what is Feedpresso and how it is different from other products that
are available on the market.

We hope that this post will help to clarify that.


## What we are?

Feedpresso is an application where you can get **recommendations** for
news news stories in **any language** from **any source**.

This means, that we will be providing news to our readers that they are
most likely to like while not limiting the content they can receive. "Any language"
and "any source" is really important to us as these are usually the
biggest obstacles the users are facing.

Furthermore, we follow these goals while developing Feedpresso:
 1. It should be **simple** to use
 1. Readers should get **relevant content**
 1. It should be available in a **local** language

This results in features like:
 * Automatic personalisation of content - Feedpresso automatically learns
 from your reading habits so it would provide relevant content while being
 simple to use.
 * A default set of sources and topics for new users in their local language -
 we don't want new users to go extra effort to start reading something
 (simple and local).
 * Multiple sources - as relevant content might be anywhere, we don't want to
 limit users here.
 * Custom sources - we let users to add their own sources of choice, so
 they would get relevant content easier and would get content from
 the sources that matter to them faster.
 * De-duplication - helps to find relevant content easier by not showing items
 that you have already read as different sources might post a story about the
 same event.

## How are we different?

There are lots of various products on the market that enable you to consume
news.

However, there are a few main categories of readers, and we don't really
fit in any of them.


### Publisher specific readers
A group of readers that you can meet very often. Usually, some publisher
(like BBC or CNN), creates an app, where they show only theirs content
and send you a constant flux of "breaking news". Some personalisation might
be available (favourite categories).

Obviously, Feedpresso allows you to get content from multiple sites,
supports very smart and automatic personalisation.

### Local news readers
A category of apps that usually expose content
from one particular site or a few preselected sites. They usually have names
like "English news reader" or "Slovak news" and just plainly aggregate articles
from different sites in one place.

No personalisation here is available: usually they don't support selecting
particular topics or sources to follow, and if they do, it is limited to
a hardcoded list.

### Topic readers
Theses readers are mainly focused on the topics that you can follow. An
example of such apps would be Prismatic, Flipboard, Zite and probably lots
of others.

The problem with this approach is that usually if you subscribe to a topic
like "startups", you will start receiving news from lots of different sites
that cover subject in very different levels. So while you might be an expert
entrepreneur, you would still receive articles like "Top 5 tips for startups"
which is most likely not interesting to you at all.

A better approach here would be to pick a specific source, which you would like
to follow. That's why Feedpresso has chosen the latter as you can do granular
selection of authors and sources that you would like to follow.

### RSS readers
There are lot of RSS readers on the market. A few really great products (Feedly)
and lots of mediocre ones. In most cases they are
simple and straightforward to use. RSS readers let you add any source you
would like to read, given that you have RSS URL available. They are usually
great at following specific blogs.

The problem with them is that you have to manually
tune them until you start getting any content at all. Furthermore, you can
quickly end up in a position where most of feed is overloaded with content
from one specific source (try reading blog posts while being subscribed to BBC).

Obviously, categories help to mitigate this, but it's not something that
makes application easy to use.

Feedpresso here provides a number of advantages:
 1. Even if there is a mixed content source (topics like criminal activity,
   foreign affairs, and entertainment), it will figure out what you like to read
   about and will put that content first.
 1. Tiny blogs will not be swallowed in content from major publishers.
 1. It provides a default list of content for new readers in their local
 language, while allowing to change it.

### Social readers
Finally, Social readers. These readers usually show content that is shared
on social networks like Twitter or Facebook. A few examples of such readers
would be the Facebook itself, Nuzzel, Briefme.

The biggest problem with them, is that you have to depend on other people to
receive a certain piece of story. Also, you must hope, that they like the
same content that they do. If your brother or sister shares a story about
entertainment, it doesn't mean that you are going to like it.

Also, if it some football cup gets really trendy between your friends
(or globally)
but
you are not into football, you are still going to receive that news stories
about that.

Furthermore, what if you like tennis, but none of your friends do? You
are not going to get any news about that.

## Conclusion
We think that Feedpresso has found a unique place in this market: start
with a simple and great experience, but do not limit the user and learn from
him.
