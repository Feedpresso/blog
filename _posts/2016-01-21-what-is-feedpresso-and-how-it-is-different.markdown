We often find ourselves in a position where we need to explain to
others what is Feedpresso and how it is different from other products available on the market.

We hope that this post will help to clarify that.

## What are we?

In Feedpresso you get **recommendations** for
news stories in **any language** from **any source**.

This means that to each of our readers, we recommend news stories that
they are most likely to like, while letting _them_ to choose their news sources.
The _any language_ and _any source_ traits are really important to us as these are usually the biggest obstacles users of other news readers are facing.

We follow these design goals while developing Feedpresso:

 1. It should be **simple** to use
 1. Readers should get **relevant content**
 1. It should be available in **local** languages

These goals lead us to features like:

 * Automatic personalisation -- Feedpresso learns from your reading habits
 'behind the scenes'. As a result, it provides relevant content while being
 simple to use.
 * A default set of sources and topics for new users in their local language
 -- we don't want new users to go through set-up just to start reading
 something (simple and local).
 * Aggregated sources -- as relevant content might be scattered all around the web, we want to give our users the tool to find it all in one place.
 * Custom sources -- we let users add their own sources of choice, so
 they would get relevant content easier and would get content from
 the sources that matter to them faster.
 * De-duplication -- helps to find relevant content easier by not showing
 items that you have already read, as different sources might post the same
 story.

## How are we different?

There are lots of various products on the market that enable you to consume
news.

However, there are a few main categories of readers, and we don't really
fit in any of them.


### Publisher-specific (i.e. brand) readers
These are apps created by a publisher (e.g. BBC or CNN), that include the
publishers' own content and send you a constant flux of "breaking news".
Some personalisation might be available (e.g. favourite categories).

Obviously, Feedpresso allows you to get content from multiple sites,
supports very smart and automatic personalisation.

### Local news readers
A category of apps that expose content from one particular site or a few
pre-selected sites. They usually have names like "UK news reader" or "Slovak
news" and simply aggregate articles from different sites in one place.

These apps usually lack personalisation features: they don't support selecting
particular topics or sources to follow, and if they do, it is limited to
a hard-coded list.

### Topic readers
Theses readers are mainly focused on the topics that you can follow.
Popular apps such as Prismatic, Flipboard, Zite and probably lots
of others fall into this category.

The problem with this approach is that if you subscribe to a topic
like "startups", you will start receiving news from lots of different sites
that cover subject in very different levels. So while you might be an expert
entrepreneur, you would still receive articles like "Top 5 tips for startups"
which is most likely not interesting to you at all.

A better approach here is to pick a specific source that you would
like to follow. And that's the route we chose with Feedpresso.

Furthermore, they support usually only English language so you would have
a hard time getting content in your local language.

### RSS readers
There are lot of RSS readers on the market. A few really great products (e.g.
Feedly) and lots of mediocre ones. In most cases, they are simple and
straightforward to use. RSS readers let you add any source you
would like to read, given that you have an RSS URL available. They are usually
great at following specific blogs.

The problem with most of them is that you have to manually tune them until you
start getting any content at all. Or worse yet, you can quickly end up in
the position where most of your feed is overloaded with content
from one specific source (try following blog posts while being subscribed to
the BBC).

Obviously, categories help to mitigate this, but it's not something that
makes application easy to use.

Feedpresso here provides a number of advantages:

1. It provides a default list of content for new readers in their local
language, while allowing you to change it.
1. Even if there is a mixed content source (topics like criminal activity,
   foreign affairs, and entertainment), it figures out what you like to read
   about and will put that content first.
1. Tiny blogs will not be swallowed in content from major publishers.


### Social readers
These readers usually show content that is shared on social networks like
Twitter or Facebook. A few examples of such readers are Facebook itself,
Nuzzel or Briefme.

The biggest problem with this approach is that you have to depend on other
people to receive a certain piece of story and you must hope that they like
the same content as you. If your co-worker shares a story about
entertainment, it doesn't mean that you are going to like it. If a football
cup gets really trendy between your friends (or globally) you are still going
to see those news stories whether you are into football or not.

And what if you like tennis, but none of your friends do? You
are not likely to see any news about that.

Also, they suffer from the same problem as topic readers - content in your
local language is not available.

## Conclusion
We think that Feedpresso has found a unique place in this market: start
with a simple and great experience, but do not limit the user and learn from
them.
