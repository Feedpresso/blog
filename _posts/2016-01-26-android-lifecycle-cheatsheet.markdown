We've put together a simple cheat sheet that summarizes Android's [Activity](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities.html) and [Fragment lifecycles](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html) in one place.

[![Android Lifecycle Cheat Sheet](/img/android-lifecycles-cheat-sheet.jpg)](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1UDBkX4KE1K5ZWQ_wRw0ffXUSxzaaosddJxsRtRxDREQ/edit?usp=sharing)

All of the diagrams come from the [Android Developers](http://developer.android.com/index.html) portal, but having them all in one place has proved to be useful for us time and time again, so we decided to share. Let us know if you find this helpful!
