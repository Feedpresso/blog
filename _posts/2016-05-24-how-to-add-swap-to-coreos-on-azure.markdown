Just a little while ago we needed to add swap to our CoreOS VMs on Azure but
we didn't find a straightforward instructions how to do that.

Hopefully, it will come handy for people that are searching for this ;)

## Instructions
Open waagent config file:

```
sudo vim /usr/share/oem/waagent.conf
```

add (or uncomment) lines

```
ResourceDisk.Format=y
ResourceDisk.Filesystem=ext4
ResourceDisk.MountPoint=/mnt/resource
ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y
ResourceDisk.SwapSizeMB=4096
```

and now restart waagent

```
sudo systemctl restart waagent
```

If you happened to follow [this](https://github.com/coreos/docs/issues/52) tutorial,
you gonna have an unstable system that's prone to freezing. Don't do that.
