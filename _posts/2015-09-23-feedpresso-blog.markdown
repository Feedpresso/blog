And here is our blog :-). We have found that we don't have yet a really good mean to communicate and explain our decisions and experiences. This new blog, we hope, is going to fill our need and a gap.

For example, we have been working quite a lot on really tiny and subtle changes on the design and overall experience of Feedpresso but our Facebook page doesn't really fit these kind of posts where people like to receive short messages and shout outs.

Also, as we are working on various things at the moment we keep discovering and learning knowledge that might not be so easy to find on the web. We hope we won't forget to share our discoveries about Android, CoreOS, Python and other parts of the stack that we are using at the moment :-).
