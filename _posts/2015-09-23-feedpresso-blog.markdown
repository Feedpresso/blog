Recently, we found that we didn't have any good means to communicate and explain our decisions and experiences. This new blog, we hope, is going to fill that need.

For example, we have been working quite a lot on tiny and subtle changes on the design and overall experience of Feedpresso but our Facebook page doesn't really fit these kind of posts where people like to receive short messages and shout outs.

As we are working on various things at the moment we keep discovering and learning knowledge that might not be so easy to find on the web. We would like to share our discoveries about Android, CoreOS, Python and other parts of the stack that we are using at the moment.
